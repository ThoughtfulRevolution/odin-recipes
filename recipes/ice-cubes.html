        <h2>Delectable Ice Cubes</h2>
        <p>In the water vs. ice debate, one argument you'll hear often is that ice is <em>too cold</em> or <em>too crunchy</em>. Those that hold these views have yet to understand not only the benefits that ice can give but also the negative associations with water. Water is a <strong>vile</strong> substance that is responsible for at least 4,500 deaths per year in the US. While not causative, it is widely held that 100% of serial killers drink water leading to the inference that water has potential psychotic effects. Furthermore, water is toxic and when consumed in quantities greater than its LD50 of 90 g/kg*, leading to confusion, seizures, and even death. Why would I consume something so caustic that it causes iron to deteriorate?</p>
        <p>Ice on the other hand is a delightful blessing of the gods. Reported benefits include:
            <ul>
                <li>reduced risk of heat stroke</li>
                <li>reduced inflammation</li>
                <li>enhanced muscle recovery</li>
                <li>and so much more!</li>
            </ul>
            The process of freezing water into ice reduces its negative effects since it takes longer to consume ice than it does water leading to reduced risk of hyponatremia. Consider this argument, when looking upon a frozen lake you will see a sheet of ice form over the top; this characteristic shows that ice was created to protect us from the hazards of the cruel water below its surface. It is only when the ice breaks that disaster is able to strike and inflict harm on the populous. That is why in this recipe, I will teach you how to protect yourself and those you love by freezing w***r.
