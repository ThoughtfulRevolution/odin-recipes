    <h2>Boot Heel Margherita Pizza</h2>
        <p>I like Margaritas <em>and</em> I like Pizza. When an Italian man came to me with an idea to combine the two, my mind was blown. I asked, "isn't there something like that in Italy?" He chuckled and said, "Silly American, when will you learn". And thus the Margherita pizza was born.</p>
        <p>Some say this story is ridiculous, but when I tell you that this conversation occurred in an alley behind the El Karajo with a mirror next to a dumpster, you might think that I've had too many margaritas*. In any case, I hope you enjoy!</p>
