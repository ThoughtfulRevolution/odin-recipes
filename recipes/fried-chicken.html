The deity can be summoned with offerings of lettuce, cucumber, and any other yield harvested from throughout the year. Much like a seance, when your family is ready to eat you will gather around the dinner table in order to summon Fried Chickoor in all its glory!

    <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Grab the large pot and add 2 gallons of canola oil to it</li>
        <li>Light all 7 candles and place them in a circle around the table.</li>
            <ul>    
             <li>Please note, this step is for your protection in the event that Fried Chickoor attempts to leave the dining area. <strong>Proceed at your own risk.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        <li>Place the pot in the middle of the dinner table and set the harvest next to the pot, <em>Carefully!</em></li>
        <li>Have the patriarch of the family slowly and continuously add the salt to the pot with their heart.
        <li>Have the matriarch of the family slowly and continuously add the pepper to the pot with their soul.</li>
        <li>As the pot begins to effervesce, have other family members rapidly throw the entirety of the harvest into the pot.</li>
        <li>Once all harvest has been added, all members must <mark>stop</mark>, <mark> sit still</mark>, and <mark>close their eyes</mark>.</li> 
        <ul>
            <li>Ignore any sounds you might hear coming from the pot as this is when Fried Chickoor will slowly crawl out of the pot and grace you with its presence. <strong>Do Not</strong> leave the circle under any circumstances.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Once all shaking has ceased and the voices have subsided, open your eyes and feast upon Fried Chickoor!</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pairs great with Chablis or Riesling</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
