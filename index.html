        <p class="story description">Welcome to Bazaar Recipes! This is my first Odin project where we were tasked with creating three recipes of our choosing. Hidden within its crevices, you will find three recipes each with its own uniqueness and character. From a simple pizza recipe to the biggest benefit to humanity, we have it all right at your finger tips. Enjoy the journey!</p>
